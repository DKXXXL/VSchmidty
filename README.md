Currently basically a reinventing the wheel of the system in *Software Foundations*, except I have proved a great deal of decidability for future extraction, and I have put all the features in type system together (Sum Type, Record Type, Subtyping) thus the definition of the core language is much larger, which bring chanllenges into the readbility and maintainability of the proof script.

The definition won't change from now on since the deciablity of the subtyping has already been proved. 

Will add stronger type system eventually (e.g. Recursive type). But don't think I will introduce side effect into this system. And keep it formally correct is very time consuming and HARD.
